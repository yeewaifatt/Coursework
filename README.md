# Fintech Case Study: Open Insurance [(Click to view Logo)](./Open_Logo.JPG)
## Overview and Origin
* Open Insurance ([www.beopen.com](https://www.beopen.com)) is a fintech company based in Australia and New Zealand.
* The company was formed in 2016.
* Its founders were Jason Wilby and Jonathan Buck who were British expats.
* The business was founded with the aim to challenge traditional financial services in Australia by offering a transparent and technology-driven model for consumers. Early products of the company were based on the concept of peer economy, aimed at reducing the cost of financial products such as loans and insurance.
* Open Insurance is a privately-held company. It successfully raised $6 million in seed funding from investors initially at inception. One of the investors was Hollard Insurance Group who is also acting as underwriter to its products. Over the next several years, Open Insurance managed to raise in excess of $50 million of additional capital in a series of funding rounds led by VC firms, Airtree Ventures and Movac.
* As it is currently a private company, it's financial performance is not disclosed in the public domain. Even though the business has yet to attain unicorn status, one of its shareholders, Airtree Ventures, is already estimating the business to be worth more than $100 million at present valuation.
## Business Activities:
* Open Insurance aims to disrupt the anachronistic and least digitally matured insurance industry by digitising insurance products and services, providing its customers access to the fatest insurance at the best possible price. 
* The business is achieving its mission by leveraging API connections and artificial intelligence (AI) to collect and analyse customer data, the result of which is used to facilitate the efficient development of tailored insurance products that can be offerred to target customers at very competitive prices. According to one of its co-founders, Mr Wilby, "Open Insurance's algorithms can detect patterns in customersâ€™ buying and claiming behaviour, and also use shared industry claims data in a systematic way that legacy systems cannot, to reduce fraudulent claims and improve the experience for honest claimants by paying them within seconds".  
* According to IBISWorld, the General Insurance market in Australia is estimated to be worth around $70 billion in 2022 and is expected to continue to grow to nearly $100 billion by 2025. Fintech start-ups such as Open Insurace which play the role of technology enablers are well poised to carve a niche in this rapidly expanding sector.
* Open Insurance markets its digital insurance products to companies including to insurers that embed them in their own digital environment as bespoke white-label insurance products, allowing their own customers to access fast insurance that is not only easy to purchase and manage but also end up saving them money. 
* Open Insurance's current network of partners includes prominent companies such as ahm, Telstra, EnergyAustralia and Plenti. Besides working with network partners, Open Insurance also markets its products under their own brand, [Huddle Insurance](https://www.huddle.com.au).
* Among other fintech companies that are competing in the same space as Open Insurance are [Cover Genius](https://www.covergenius.com/), [Kanopi](https://www.kanopicover.com/) and [AP Intego](https://apintego.com/). Like Open Insurance, Kanopi also delivers embedded insurance which enables insurers and platform partners to work together to offer customised products that protect customers based on their needs. The Melbourne-based company managed to raise some capital last year through Hollard Insurance Group, the same company that provided seed funding to Open Insurance. Kanopi was preparing to expand its product offerrings and launch into the US market following the successful capital raise. AP Intego, a US-based business, was founded with the singular idea of uncomplicating business insurance for small business owners. It's approach is no different - to apply tech innovation to the traditional insurance agency experience to deliver amazing customer service. On the other hand, Cover Genius was born out of the need to provide insurance cover for overseas customers of a local online travel business. The lack of global coordination to provide solution and platform is the reason for their business to thrive.
* What sets Open Insurance apart from competitors is that it offers an Open Sandbox environment with detailed step-by-step guide complete with programming codes on their [webpage](https://developers.beopen.com/docs) to help partners to quickly develop and test their app for business process and system integration. Essentially, it is a plug-and-play model where partners can choose to either become an affiliate by referring their customers to Huddle Insurance directly to get a quote; or become a distributor where Huddle's platform is embeded on their website and integrated in their business process. 

## Landscape:
* The nascent insurtech domain has attracted a lot of interests from serious investors within the insurance and banking and finance sectors. 
* Traditionally, these sectors are heavily regulated. They are encumbered with multiple layers of legal ramifications that tend to discourage the incumbents from working with start-ups such as Open Insurance. However, with the growing interest that these start-ups have managed to garner from consumers who prefer user-friendly, time-efficient and cost effective products, the incumbents can no longer afford to shy away from engaging with these start-up companies. Some of these companies may eventually end up being acquisition targets for the incumbents as their fledgling businesses start to mature.
* Fintech Australia, a lobby group made up of a good majority of players within the industry, was formed back in 2016 to represent and advocate for the Australian fintech industry. It works closely with the government and the industry to develop new approach to accelerate innovation in the financial sector and drive consumer and business demand for fintech while ensuring that the security and stability of the financial system remains sound and intact.  
* As the leading voice for the industry, Fintech Australia had successfully lobbied the government to introduce a legislative framework for an enchanced regulatory sandbox that enables fintech companies to test their financial products and services with their customers without the need to jump through too many hoops. The initial scope of the sandbox set by ASIC was considered too narrow as it had excluded mnarketplace lenders and fintechs from working in the areas of superannuation and life insurance. As a result, Fintech Australia responded by establishing a working group of relevant members from the finance and insurance industry to develop a policy framework and a set of recommendations that were ultimately adopted by the regulatory body.
* Since 2017, both QBE and IAG, two of the three largest insurance companies in Australia with a combined market share of nearly 40%, have invested vast sums of money into setting up insurtech hubs and investing in fintech start-ups to varying degree of success. 
* IAG has inaugurated its Sydney and Singapore-based labs, both named Firemark, acting as incubators for the insurer to work collaboratively with fintech companies in the insurtech domain to research and come up with innovative products. At around the same time, QBE also unveiled its Group Digital Innovation Lab focussed on embedding technology into its business processes. QBE's focus on technology is driven by its need to get 'sharper information' to improve the pricing and performance of products; to ensure that it is getting the best outcomes for claims settlement and stronger insights into customer buying habits, different industry segments and classes of insurance.
* On a global scale, Australia still has a lot of grounds to cover. According to CB Insights, insurtech start-ups atrracted US$1.69 billion of investments in 2016, with only a mere 1 per cent of this coming to Australia.

## Recommendations
* As the digital adoption rate within the insurance industry gradually increases, the prospect for Open Insurance to carve a niche in this fast-changing marketplace will be greatly enhanced. In this era of digital economy driven by big data, Open Insurance is well positioned to leverage new technology to add value to the design and delivery of innovative insurance solutions that will ultimately drive customer savings and improve overall satisfaction.
* Offering pay per use insurance based on individual habits and lifestyle choices can be a very attractive proposition to consumers who want to retain autonomy over the choice of product and how much they would like to spend on. As a majority of the insurance policies today are set for a fixed duration for renewal, typically a year, it will certainly be a game changer if consumers can instead obtain micro-type cover i.e. for shorter periods, on a need-to basis via their mobile device, for a fraction of the cost.  
* For instance, one can choose to purchase a personal accident cover for a 3-day camping trip to the bush or extend insurance cover for home contents when going away for a short holiday. Such flexibility will likely remove any objections for the consumers due to price and cause them to be more willing to consider taking up an insurance policy instead of choosing to self-insure due to the lack of cost effective solutions.
* Additionally, consumers like to be rewarded for their personal choices. Someone who drives once a week should be paying a lower premium as compared to someone who is behind the wheel nearly everyday of the week. By the same token, one who exercises regularly should contribute a lower private healthcare premium as compared to someone who leads a sedentary lifestyle. Yet another example is one who plays extreme sport or work in a hazardous environment should pay more for insurance than someone who plays it safe in life and has a deskbound job.
* With today's technology, it has become possible to track people's movements and travel speeds via satellites using GPS technology. Additionally, an individual's stress level can also be tracked by the intermittent monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure readings captured via a smartwatch worn on the wrist. In a real-life example, NRMA has adopted a technology that rewards safe drivers with discounted premium when they voluntarily downloaded an app that automatically puts their phone on flight mode to reduce distractions when they are driving. 
* Information gathered from these devices can then be automatically collated and transmitted over the internet to a central database for realtime analysis and depending on the outcomes, premiums can be adjusted accordingly on an individual basis as opposed to falling back on the conventional pool concept that the insurance industry has been operating under since time immemorial.
* Further, AI and machine learning can now be deployed on the massive trove of data gathered from various sources, including data shared within the partner network to run business modelling which can accurately predict future trends. Only by harnessing the power of computing will it be possible to efficiently process and analyse the massive load of data flowing in constantly to help shape business decisions as well as aid the development of new products and solutions that meet the ever-evolving needs of consumers.
* As an example of leveraging technology to create innovative product, it is now possible to identify people with similar characteristics from the data ppol and then group them under a peer insurance scheme that refunds a portion of premiums back to them if there were no claims made by the end of the policy. This P2P innovation is reportedly the brainchild of Friendinsure, a German based fintech company that boasts of James Packer-backed Ellerston Capital, as one of its shareholders. 
## Conclusion
The booming insurtech sector is a testament to the importance of developments made in the areas of power computing and information technology. Their roles in disrupting the traditional insurance industry, causing it to constantly reimagine itself and push the frontiers cannot be overstated. We are all bearing witness to an important chapter in the evolution of the insurance industry.
