# Fintech Case Study: Open Insurance [Logo:](C:/Users/Wai Fatt Yee/GitHub/Fintech_Bootcamp/Homework/Open Logo.jpg)
## Overview and Origin
* Open Insurance ([www.beopen.com](www.beopen.com)) is a fintech company based in Australia and New Zealand,
* The company was formed in 2016.
* Its founders were Jason Wilby and Jonathan Buck who were British expats.
* Early products were based on the concept of peer economy aimed at reducing the cost of financial products such as loans and insurance.
* Open Insurance is a privately held company. It managed to raise $6 million seed funding from investors initially (2016) which included Hollard Insurance Group as one of the seed investors that also acted as underwriter to its products. Over the next several years, Open Insurance managed to raise more capital, in excess of $50 million, in a series of funding rounds led by VC firms, Airtree Ventures and Movac.
* As it is currently a private company, it's financial performance is not disclosed in the public domain. Even though the business is yet to attain unicorn status, one of its shareholders, Airtree Ventures, estimates the business to be worth more than $100 million now.
## Business Activities:
* Open Insurance aims to disrupt the anachronistic and least digitally matured insurance industry by digitising insurance, providing its customers access to the fatest insurance at the best possible price. 
* The business is achieving its mission by leveraging artificial intelligence to collect and analyse customer data that will in turn enable them to offer tailored insurance products to their own customers at competitive and reasonable pricing. According to one of the co-founders, Mr Wilby, Open Insurance's algorithms can detect patterns in customers’ buying and claiming behaviour, and also use shared industry claims data in a systematic way that legacy systems cannot, to reduce fraudulent claims and improve the experience for honest claimants by paying them within seconds.  
* According to IBISWorld, the General Insurance market in Australia is estimated to be worth around $70 billion in 2022. 
* Open Insurance markets its digital insurance products to companies including insurers that embed them in their own digital experience as bespoke white-label insurance products, allowing their own customers to access fast insurance that is not only easy to buy and manage but also saves them money. Open Insurance's current partner network includes ahm, Telstra, EnergyAustralia and Plenti. Besides partnering with businesses, Open Insurance also sell their products through their own brand, Huddle ([www.huddle.com.au](www.huddle.com.au)).

## Recommendations
* As the digital adoption rate within the insurance industry increases over time, the opportunity for Open Insurance to carve a niche in the insurance market is immense. In this era of digital economy driven by big data analysis, Open Insurance is well positioned to add value to the design and delivery of innovative insurance solutions and drive customer savings.
* Offering pay per use insurance based on individual habits and lifestyle can be a very compelling proposition to consumers. As majority of the insurance policies are currently set for renewal on an annual basis, it will be seen as a game changer if consumers can obtain cover for shorter periods as they require instead of being retricted to purchasing cover for the entire year. 
* For instance, one can choose to purchase a personal accident cover for a 3-day camping trip in the bush or extend insurance cover for home contents when going away for a short holiday. Such flexibility will almost certainly cause consumers to be more willing to consider taking up cover instead of choosing to self-isure due to the lower cost from the shorter period of cover. Additionally, consumers like to be recognised and rewarded for their personal choices. Someone who drives once a week should be paying a lower premium as compared to someone who is behind the wheel nearly everyday of the week. One who exercises regularly should pay a lower private healthcare premium compared to someone who leads sedentary life.
* With today's technology, it has become possible to track people's movements and travel speeds via satellite using GPS. Additionally, an individual's hear rate and blood pressure can be monitored via the smartwatch s/he wears.
* Information from these devices can be automatically collated and transmitted over the internet to a database for realtime analysis and the depending on the results, the individual's premiums can be adjusted accordingly.
* Further, AI and Machine Learning can be deployed on the massive trove of data collected over time to predict future trends which will in turn help shape business decisions; and develop new products and solutions that meet the evolving needs of consumers.
